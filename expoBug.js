While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server failed to start, displaying an error message related to a missing or corrupted dependency. This error was inconsistent, occurring sporadically and without any clear pattern.  The error messages varied but generally indicated problems with resolving packages or finding required modules. My project's package.json and package-lock.json files appeared to be correct, and running `npm install` or `yarn install` did not resolve the issue.
