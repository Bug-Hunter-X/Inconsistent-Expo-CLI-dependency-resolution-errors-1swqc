The solution involved several steps to address the problem systematically. First, a complete cleanup was performed to remove any potentially corrupted cache files: 

```bash
npm cache clean --force
yarn cache clean
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf package-lock.json
```

Next, the project dependencies were reinstalled: 

```bash
npm install
```

If npm install still failed, yarn install was tried.  If the error persisted, the `expo prebuild` command was used to ensure that the project's dependencies were correctly configured. In one instance, globally installed Expo CLI packages were found to be corrupt, and reinstalling Expo CLI solved the issue.

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

Finally, if all else failed, creating a new project and copying the project code and configuration files was necessary.  This ensured that no underlying configuration issues caused the conflict.
